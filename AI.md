ChatGPT was used to generate the header contents for this Java Keef ChatBot Application 
in Week 3 A-JavaDoc. I wrote 3 Javadocs myself just to get a feel for it, but soon realised 
that it's too tedious to incorporate it for all classes and methods. 

Using ChatGPT saved a lot of time for me to work on other increments instead.
